# SquareOne Docker

> SquareOne Docker is a command line application that provides a local docker based development environment for projects 
> based on the [SquareOne](https://github.com/moderntribe/square-one) framework. This is an internal Modern Tribe project, 
> while you may use it, it's heavily based on our internal tools and workflow and many features will not work out of the box.
